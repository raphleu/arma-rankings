      <h2>League rules</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      The goal of having leagues and rankings is for it to be fun and fair for everyone. To make this possible, some basic rules are required.
	 <div>
      <h3>1. Show up on time</h3>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 1.1 The first match starts on the hour, the second usually 25-30 minutes after that, and so on. Any player not present when it starts will not be allowed to play and their rating will not be affected by that match.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 1.2 Players who repeatedly fail to show up for their matches will be given warnings followed by bans of increasing length.
      </div>
      <h3>2. Don't leave early</h3>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 2.1(a) All players are expected to display basic sportsmanship by staying until the end of the match. This also saves the admins from doing extra work to record the results.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 2px;">
      § 1.2 Players who repeatedly fail to show up for their matches will be given warnings followed by bans of increasing length.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 2.2 Players who briefly lose their connection to the server may rejoin the match and recover their points.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 2.3 A player has until the start of the 5th round to leave the match without it counting in the case of unforeseen lag (or equivalent). To do so they must announce their intention in the game chat before switching to spectator mode.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 2.4(a) A player who loses their connection to the server before the start of the 5th round and doesn't intend to rejoin the match must return to the server and announce that they’re opting to sit out.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 2px;">
      § 2.4(b) A player who loses their connection to the server after the start of the 5th round – and can’t rejoin in time – will be given their last known score as their final score and is advised to appeal to an admin on discord as soon as possible to avoid being penalized according to § 2.1(b).
      </div>
      
      <h3>3. It's not a chat room</h3>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 3.1 Players must keep their chat to a minimum to allow the other players to focus on the match. Since being silenced doesn’t prevent one from playing the game, any player leaving the server upon being silenced may be penalized for leaving early (see § 2.1(b)).
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 5px;">
      § 3.2 Spectators should keep the spectator chat related to the game at hand. Discussions unrelated to the ongoing match are advised to be held elsewhere. Any unnecessary use of the /shout command may be met with silencing the one who shouted without warning.
